How to Mark Events
2013-07-23 Foldes


Don't clean up too much, need to later add way to remove events that don't happen at the right time points (maybe add to GUI_Auto_Remove_Events_wBadSegments)

- Don't forget, if they miss the first move in a block, remove the previous rest, they were sleeping


blink
	left-mouse click best blink signal (EOG spikes)
	"s"
	change parameters to best mark blinks, should have >20 events, marker should be in the center of the blink, long duration is not blinks
		- thres should be first parameters to try
		- Too big Thres can also be used if big things w/ the correct structure are being left out.
		- Max Artifact RateS and Peak WindowS shouldn't be used
	If new parameters are entered, selected "Okay" and reinspect results
	If parameters are good, then select "Cancel"
	Look at events. 
		- add more events by putting cursor over time and pushing '1'
		- remove an event with cursor near the time point, press 'delete'
		- Use normal Inspection navigation
		- should have >20 events
	To accept, press 's'
	
cardiac
	Same, but this should be a bunch of quick spikes
	Anything long or big is not ECG, probably need to remove manually w/ inspector at the end.


MISC (Photodiode)
	For Imagine/Attempt, this isn't active, just click 'esc' and 'No Save'

Artifact Free Move (For Imagine/Observe ONLY)
	Select one or more signals that could have artifacts info on them (usually one on top and one on bottom)
	's'
	Adjust parameters (esp. thres), press "okay"
	Once satisfied, press "cancel"
	You do the same thing for each signal you selected
	Manually remove markers with 'del' that still look noisy
	Hopefully you have over 50 (80/90 is max)
	's' to save

EMG and ACC (For Imitate/Attempt ONLY)

Artifact Free Rest
	Select one or more signals that could have artifacts info on them (usually one on top and one on bottom)
	's'
	Adjust parameters (esp. thres), press "okay"
	Once satisfied, press "cancel"
	You do the same thing for each signal you selected
	Manually remove markers with 'del' that still look noisy
	Hopefully you have over 10
	's' to save


================
===SSP==========
================

Select SSP-components for blinks
	Plots show 500ms around blink centers for each componet
	First plot is interquantile range
	2nd plot is interactive where you click the SSP-components to build a filter (this plot shows multiple blinks and 500ms around)
	Bottom components are the strongest
	Usually pick bottom compenent and any component that is already red (already selected)
	Any compent w/ a pattern, select
	's' to save
	Next plot shows how the removal of components affects the signal (red - clean) patterns should be removed, push 's' to save ('q' to redo)

Select SSP-components for cardiac
	Plots show 500ms around blink centers for each componet
	First plot is interquantile range
	2nd plot is interactive where you click the SSP-components to build a filter (this plot shows multiple ECG)
	Bottom components are the strongest
	Usually pick bottom compenent and any component that is already red (already selected)
	Any compent w/ a pattern, select (unlikely much for cardiac)
	's' to save
	Next plot shows how the removal of components affects the signal (red - clean) patterns should be removed, push 's' to save ('q' to redo)
